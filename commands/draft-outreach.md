description: Draft signal-grounded outreach for a contact using Customer Context Graph data.
---

Ask: "Who do you want to reach out to, and what's the goal — new outreach, follow-up, or re-engage?"

Use the draft-outreach skill. Research the contact and account first. Write from the strongest signal. Deliver two versions with a note on why you led with that signal.
