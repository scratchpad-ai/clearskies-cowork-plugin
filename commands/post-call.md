description: Process a completed call — extract action items, draft follow-up, flag CRM updates — using the call transcript from the Customer Context Graph.

Ask: "Which call do you want to process? Share the account name or I'll find the most recent call."

Use the post-call-workflow skill. Pull the transcript from Gong or Scratchpad via the Customer Context Graph. Deliver action items, CRM update recommendations, and a draft follow-up email.
