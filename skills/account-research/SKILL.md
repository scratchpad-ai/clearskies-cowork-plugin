# Account Research

When asked to research an account or contact, query the Customer Context Graph through the Clearskies MCP before responding. Do not rely on web search alone — real buyer context is in the graph.

## What to pull

For an account:
- **CRM data**: deal stage, deal value, close date, owner, account health
- **Call data**: recent call transcripts, key topics discussed, commitments made, concerns raised
- **Email data**: recent email threads, response rates, last contact date
- **Calendar data**: upcoming meetings, recent meeting history
- **Slack data**: internal deal discussions, account channel activity, mentions

For a contact:
- Title, role, relationship history
- Their participation in calls and emails
- Any notes or context from CRM
- Recent activity signals

## Output format

Deliver a structured brief — not a data dump. Surface the most relevant signals:

**[Company / Contact Name]**
- **Relationship status**: last contact date, engagement health, open deals
- **Recent activity**: what happened in the last 30 days across all sources
- **Key signals**: anything that suggests urgency, risk, or opportunity
- **Recommended next step**: one clear action based on the context

Keep it scannable. A rep should be able to read this in 60 seconds.
