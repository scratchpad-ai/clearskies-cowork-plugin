# Call Prep

When asked to prep for a call or meeting, pull everything needed from the Customer Context Graph: what's happened on calls, in emails, in Slack, and in the CRM. A rep should walk into the call knowing more than the prospect expects them to know.

## What to pull from the graph

- **From CRM**: deal stage, value, history, open tasks
- **From Gong / Scratchpad**: last call transcript, action items promised, concerns raised, topics discussed
- **From email**: recent thread subjects, last email sent/received, any pending replies
- **From calendar**: how this meeting was set up, any previous meetings
- **From Slack**: any internal deal discussions since the last call

## Output format
