# Draft Outreach

Never draft outreach cold. Always pull Customer Context Graph data for the contact and account first, then write from the strongest signal.

## What to look for in the graph

- **Most recent touch**: when, what channel, outcome
- **Strongest signal**: what's happening at their company or with their engagement
- **Relationship history**: have we spoken before? What was discussed?
- **Open loops**: anything promised or unresolved from previous interactions

## Principles

- **Lead with their world, not our product**: open with something specific to them — a signal, a trigger, a reference to a previous conversation
- **One signal, one ask**: don't pile on value props
- **Short**: email under 100 words, LinkedIn under 75 words
- **Specific CTA**: a clear, low-friction next step

## Output

Provide 2 versions:

**Version A — Re-engage / follow-up** (for accounts with prior history in the graph)
Opens with a reference to the last interaction or a specific signal since then.

**Version B — Signal-led cold** (for new contacts with account context in the graph)
Opens with a company signal or trigger, no mention of prior relationship.

Include a one-line note on which signal you led with and why.
